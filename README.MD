# Happy Chart
Happy chart is a program I wrote using:
- eframe
- egui
- serde
- chrono
- serde_json
### Purpose:
Happy chart is an idea I had, where I wanted to graph the subjective quality of each day, at the time I used a spreadsheet software but realized it would be a really fun programming project to make in rust, which I'm trying to practice anyway.

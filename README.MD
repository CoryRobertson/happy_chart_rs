# Happy Chart
Happy chart is a program I wrote using:
- eframe
- egui
- serde
- serde_json
- chrono

### Purpose:
Happy chart is an idea I had, where I wanted to graph the subjective quality of each day, at the time I used a spreadsheet software but realized it would be a really fun programming project to make in rust, which I'm trying to practice anyway.

If anyone uses this program, I would absolutly love to know if there are any features that would make the program better. 
I would also love to know if anyone uses this program, and what they do and don't like about it, as I personally love using it, and its really movitvating to hear people enjoying things I have made. :)

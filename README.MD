# Happy Chart
## A multipurpose daily journaling software

### Purpose:
Happy chart is an idea I had, where I wanted to graph the subjective quality of each day, at the time I used a spreadsheet software but realized it would be a really fun programming project to make in rust, which I'm trying to practice anyway.

If anyone uses this program, I would absolutely love to know if there are any features that would make the program better. 
I would also love to know if anyone uses this program, and what they do and don't like about it, as I personally love using it, and it's really motivating to hear people enjoying things I have made. :)

### Features:
- JSON based stat saving locally relative to the program executable
- JSON based program settings saved relative to program executable
- _somewhat_ pretty stat visualization
- Automagic updating
- Screenshotting system
- Mild amount of customization and settings to play with
- Automatic program data backups ( if enabled )
- Journal entry mood tagging
- Export save file to CSV
- Statistics calculations of journal entries
- Save fil encryption
- Skip-able embedded basic usage tutorial


### Contributions and suggestions:
I love working on this program, if you have any ideas, please feel free to send a pull request, or create an issue. I will always consider them!
